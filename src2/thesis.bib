For wide SIMD many-core architectures, we present a novel stream compaction algorithm and explore several variations thereof. Our algorithm is designed to maximize concurrent execution, with minimal use of synchronization. Bandwidth and auxiliary storage requirements are reduced significantly, which allows for substantially
better performance.

We have tested our algorithms using CUDA on a PC with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX280 GPU. On this hardware, our reference implementation provides a 3x speedup over previous published algorithms.},

 abstract = {
    Graphics processing units (GPUs) provide both memory bandwidth and arithmetic
    performance far greater than that available on CPUs, but, because of their
    \emph{Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data} (SIMD) architecture, they are hard to program.
    Most of the programs ported to GPUs thus far use traditional data-level
    parallelism, performing only operations that operate uniformly over vectors.
    Porting algorithms that do not easily fit this model requires laborious manual
    program conversion to run programs with irregular control-flow or data layout.
    Language support for programming GPUs is rather limited.
    The low-level GPU languages, such as CUDA and OpenCL, appear general-purpose, but
    must be used in restricted styles to get adequate performance.
    Some effort has been made to support computation on GPUs from high-level
    languages, such as C++, X10, and Haskell, but these mechanisms are
    limited to computations over flat vectors.

    NESL is a first-order functional language that was designed by
    Guy Blelloch to allow programmers to write irregular-parallel programs --- such as parallel
    divide-and-conquer algorithms --- for wide-vector parallel computers.
    NESL supports \emph{nested data parallelism} (NDP), where the elements of
    a data-parallel computation can themselves be data-parallel computations, and
    it uses a novel compilation technique, called \emph{flattening}, to map nested
    computations onto a SIMD execution model.
    This work demonstrated that NDP can be effectively used for a wide
    range of irregular-parallel computations.

    Wide-vector machines pose many of the same programming challenges as GPUs, so it
    is worth exploring the question of whether an NDP language, like NESL, can make an
    effective tool for programming GPUs.
    This paper presents the results of such an exploration.
    We describe our port of the NESL implementation to work on GPUs and present
    empirical evidence that NDP on GPUs significantly outperforms CPU-based
    implementations and matches or beats newer GPU languages that support only flat
    parallelism.
    We also compare our performance with hand-tuned CUDA programs.
    While our performance does not match that of hand-tuned codes, we argue that the
    notational conciseness of NESL is worth the loss in performance.
    This work provides the first language implementation that directly supports NDP
    on a GPU.

Our radix sort is the fastest GPU sort and our merge sort is the fastest comparison-based sort reported in the literature. Our radix sort is up to 4 times faster than the graphics-based GPUSort and greater than 2 times faster than other CUDA-based radix sorts. It is also 23\% faster, on average, than even a very carefully optimized multicore CPU sorting routine. To achieve this performance, we carefully design our algorithms to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and decompose the computation into independent tasks that perform minimal global communication. We exploit the high-speed onchip shared memory provided by NVIDIA's GPU architecture and efficient data-parallel primitives, particularly parallel scan. While targeted at GPUs, these algorithms should also be well-suited for other manycore processors.},

We offer a candidate list of desirable qualities for a parallel programming language, and describe how these qualities are addressed in the design of the Chapel language. In doing so, we provide an overview of Chapel's features and how they help address parallel productivity. We also survey current techniques for parallel programming and describe ways in which we consider them to fall short of our idealized productive programming model.},

We embed GPU kernels as data-parallel array computations in the purely functional language Haskell. GPU and CPU computations can be freely interleaved with the type system tracking the two different modes of computation. The embedded language of array computations is sufficiently limited that our system can automatically extract these computations and compile them to efficient GPU code. In this paper, we outline our approach and present the results of a few preliminary benchmarks.},

"The rapid increase in the performance of graphics hardware, coupled with recent improvements in its programmability, have made graphics hardware a compelling platform for computationally demanding tasks in a wide variety of application domains. In this report, we describe, summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose appli
 cation development on graphics hardware.",

Over the past six years, there has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">general-purpose computing on the GPU,</emphasis> also known as <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">GPU computing,</emphasis> has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications. </para>},
